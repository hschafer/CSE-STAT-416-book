# System Requirements
* Make sure you have installed the system requirements from [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim). If you're using a Mac, you will most likely use `brew` to install them.

# Python Requirements
* Sometimes your Python versions might have some mismatches and you might need to downgrade. [This file](https://github.com/3b1b/manim/blob/master/environment.yml) has some known versions that work with `manim`.
